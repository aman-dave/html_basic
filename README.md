## Basic HTML Website: Trip Management

This repository is a part of my blog I wrote on learning HTML and CSS from scratch. 
I have implemented basic HTML and used Bootstrap for CSS. Javascript has been used to take inputs
and handle the basic forms.

The repository contains an underlying exercise where the user can connect form using 
Javascript and display the inputs given by user.
